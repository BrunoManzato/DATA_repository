----->Breaf desciption of folders in this directory (they are in chronological order of development):
-->Obs.: Simulations from 1 to 8 (except number 5) has one muon for each root file that was projected 
rightly in the center of the bigger face of the detector.


	1)TestFIberNumber
	-->18 simulations of 1 5GeV Muon event, changing the number of fibers
	 from 10 (output0.root) to 100 (output18.root). Each one has 5 more fibers
	 than the one before (output1.root has 15 fibers, output2.root has 20 fibers, ...). 
	 Here we are still using 100% capture rate for fibers.  
	 


	2)TestFiberNumberV2
	-->Same as TestFIberNumber, to compare results, because there was just one simulation 
	 for each number of fibers. It's because we were still developing the simulation and 
	 will consume to much time.
	 
	 
	3)Test5PerCentCapture
	-->Same as TestFIberNumber, but we have 5% capture rate of photons that reach
	 the SiPM in order to simulate the effect of loss into the fiber, because we
	 weren't able to do this by physics (futurely we can adjust this to leave the
	 correct capture rate to physics).
	
	
	4)Test100Muons
	-->100 different simulations of 1 5GeV muon going into the center of the detector
	with the "perfect" conditions of the plastic scintillator and fiber position. The simulation
	uses 100 cm x 100 cm x 3cm plastic scintillator EJ-200 with 40 fibers in each surface.
	
	
	5)Positionchange
	-->Test changing the position of the incident muon to test the accuracy of the sistem.
	
	
	6)NoReflectivity
	-->100 simulations of 1 5GeV muon with no reflectivity cover over the detector to test
	 possible photon losses due to this.
	
	
	7)Bubbles
	-->100 simulations of 1 5GeV muon with bubbles over one surface of the detector. The bubbles
	 were at the side that is labbled in root files as "X axis".
	
	
	8)0mm_GAP, 0.5mm_GAP, and 1mm_GAP
	-->100 simulations of 1 5GeV muon and with a gap of 0mm, 0.5mm and 1mm between the fibers and
	 the scintillator. We reproduced the 0mm simulation because we changed a bit the construction
	 in simulation, using an air cover over all the detector to still simulate the reflective cover
	 above it.
